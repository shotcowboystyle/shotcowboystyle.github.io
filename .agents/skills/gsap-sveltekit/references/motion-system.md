# Lifecycle implementation

Read this to implement the five phases for pages and components without layout shift.

## The contract

**mount → initial state → intro → settled → outro → end state → unmount**

One controller owns a node from mount to unmount and exposes one current phase:

1. **Initial state.** Mounted, final size reserved, measured, start values applied, not yet shown.
2. **Intro.** One timeline from initial values to settled.
3. **Settled.** Visible, stable, interactive, and controlled by normal CSS.
4. **Outro.** Still mounted while one timeline moves it toward removal.
5. **End state.** Still mounted, final values applied, completion run once. Safe to unmount.

The user's request defines how each phase looks. If it only describes an intro or outro, implement the other phases as the minimum needed to enter and leave cleanly.

Store the current phase in `$state` and render it as a data attribute on the owned node. Do not infer it from opacity, DOM presence, or timeline progress.

## Setup

Create one module that imports GSAP and only the plugins the project uses, registers them once behind a `browser` guard, and exports them. Other modules import from it.

Give every owner a `gsap.context` scoped to its `bind:this` root, created in `onMount` or `$effect` and reverted in the returned cleanup:

- Selectors inside the context match only inside that root.
- `revert()` on the context kills every tween, trigger, and split it created and restores inline styles.
- Wrap callbacks and event handlers that create GSAP work in `context.add` so they belong to the context.
- Store listeners, observers, and timers next to the context and remove them in the same cleanup.
- Keep `page`, `data`, and `navigating` out of the effect body, or the context reverts and rebuilds on every navigation.

Write setup so it is correct when it runs more than once on the same node. A page reused after a param change, an effect re-run, and a presence controller re-showing content all hand you a node that already holds settled values. Write initial state explicitly with `set` or `fromTo` rather than a `from` tween that trusts a fresh node, and make cleanup leave the node readable.

## Initial state

Build the final layout with normal CSS first. The initial state changes appearance, not layout. The element that owns geometry must exist before the animated node does.

- Mount content before measuring or animating it. Await `tick()` after a state change before measuring what it rendered.
- Give images and media dimensions or an aspect ratio.
- Reserve async and streamed regions with a wrapper when their size is known.
- Prefer transforms, `autoAlpha`, masks, or clipping, which keep the layout box.

If the effect changes width, height, or position:

- Animate a transform on an inner element while an outer wrapper holds the settled size.
- For a real expand or collapse, measure start and end sizes first, animate the wrapper, and decide how surrounding content moves.
- For layout-to-layout changes, use Flip: capture the old state, apply the new layout, animate.
- When old and new content share one region, reserve the parent and overlap the children so only the parent affects layout.

Content must stay readable without JavaScript. The pre-paint rule in [The swap gap and initial state](sveltekit-navigation.md#the-swap-gap-and-initial-state) is the only sanctioned way to hide server-rendered content before the intro.

## Initialization and recovery

Apply the [initialization contract](initialization.md) whenever content starts hidden. It includes recovery ordering, indexing/performance limits, and failure checks.

- Put the early marker and independent deadline before `%sveltekit.body%` in `src/app.html`, respecting the installed CSP integration. SSR/prerendered pages stay readable without hydration; with `ssr = false`, test the actual static fallback.
- Keep the visit and recovery record in the persistent layout controller. Register rollback from synchronous `onMount`/`$effect` setup before writes. Check the token again after `tick()`, fonts, media, and navigation promises; async setup must not lose its teardown.
- `afterNavigate` handles reused pages as well as newly mounted ones. Start a deadline when the incoming owner first hides, including the swap gap. Do not reset it when the same route's builder registers again or data invalidates.
- Invalidate the outgoing entrance before `onNavigate` starts its outro. Resolve interrupted navigation waits once. Remove only that visit's cover/snapshot and lock; never reveal a lingering `out:` block, stale clone, or shallow-route modal. Recheck on bfcache return and leave the restored active page readable.

## Intro and settled

Write reusable intro and outro builders only when behavior repeats. Each returns a timeline so the controller can compose, kill, reverse, or await it.

- Make settled the source of truth. It must not depend on a paused timeline.
- Clear temporary transform, visibility, transition, and `will-change` styles once settled.
- Run intro completion and settled callbacks once, including under reduced motion.
- On rapid state changes, replace, kill, or reverse the active timeline. Do not stack conflicting tweens.
- Update assistive text and state immediately. Animate the visual, not the meaning.

## Outro and end state

Start the outro from current rendered values. Keep the node mounted, laid out, and owned until the timeline completes.

- Reject duplicate outro requests or define which wins.
- If an intro is running, reverse it only when the outro is its exact inverse. Otherwise kill it and build the outro from current values.
- Disable pointer events when the visual can no longer support them, without removing the layout box.
- Run end-state work once. Only then flip the state that removes the node, resolve the router's wait, or hand off.
- Kill the active timeline on cleanup, but do not erase state the route cover still needs.
- No `{#if}` removal, `hidden`, or `display: none` before the outro completes.

## Conditional show and hide

`{#if}` removes a block synchronously, before a GSAP outro can play. Add a presence controller where that matters. It should:

- Render while `visible || leaving`, so the node mounts into initial state before the intro and stays through settled and outro.
- Keep the active timeline.
- On re-show during an outro, reverse only if that gives the intended intro. Otherwise kill, set from current values, and build a fresh intro.
- Clear `leaving` only from the end-state callback.
- Keep all five phases under reduced motion.

For a plain fade or slide with nothing gated on completion, an `out:` directive on the block already holds it in the DOM until the outro ends. Use that instead of a controller, and keep GSAP off that node.

When content in a shared region changes size, decide who owns the region's geometry before mounting either child. Overlap old and new inside a reserved wrapper, or animate a measured wrapper between known sizes. Do not let unmount then mount push surrounding content twice.

Do not use presence for content that can simply appear, or for pages the layout controller already manages.

- Focus a panel when its intro completes, not when it mounts. An element at `visibility: hidden` refuses focus silently, and `autoAlpha: 0` is exactly that. Reduced motion completes synchronously, so the focus still lands.
- When the end callback clears `leaving`, Svelte removes the node in its next flush, not immediately. Clear only `will-change` there; clearing a collapsed height or visibility in the same tick flashes the content at full size for a frame.

A shallow-routed modal is a presence controller whose close is `history.back()`. See [Conditional content](page-lifetime.md#conditional-content).

## Reduced and responsive motion

The OS preference is the default. Add an app override only if the product needs one.

Every effect needs initial, settled, and end states under reduced motion. Do not just shorten a disorienting effect. Skip travel, rotation, scale, parallax, and scrambling unless essential. A zero-duration timeline or an immediate `set` still fires completion for anything that depends on it.

Use `gsap.matchMedia()` for responsive and reduced-motion variants that must rebuild when conditions change. Create it inside the owner's context so it reverts with the owner. Do not nest a second context for the same setup.

An app-level override is not a media query, so `matchMedia` cannot see it. Read it in a shared `prefersReducedMotion()` helper that every timeline consults, mirror it as a root attribute so CSS can key on it, and for setups inside a `matchMedia` block make the override a dependency of the owning effect so the block rebuilds when it changes. Svelte's own `prefersReducedMotion` from `svelte/motion` covers directives; feed both from the same decision.

## Scroll

Use `gsap-scrolltrigger` for the API; these rules cover route lifetime and measurement.

- Create triggers in document order. Refresh after fonts, images, streamed data, or dynamic content change layout, after `tick()`.
- Create triggers inside the owning context. Do not kill all triggers globally when one page leaves. A layout's triggers survive child navigations; a page's leave with it.
- A page reused with new params keeps its triggers against changed content. Refresh them from `afterNavigate` after the DOM settles.
- On `popstate` the router restores scroll before `afterNavigate`. Refresh there. Reveal-on-scroll targets above the restored position must not stay hidden.
- A `will-change` written from an `onToggle` callback is outside the context and survives its revert. Write it as a plain style and undo it in cleanup, or write it before the trigger is created.

Under reduced motion, go straight from initial to settled without unnecessary triggers. Keep outro and end callbacks that resolve navigation or removal.

## Text

Use SplitText when the effect needs per-character, word, or line targets.

- For character splits, keep scoped `font-kerning: none; text-rendering: optimizeSpeed` before, during, and after revert, including reduced motion. Wrappers disrupt kerning and can cause horizontal snapping; use words/lines if natural kerning is essential. See [SplitText limitations](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText/#tips--limitations).
- Apparent weight changes can be clipped ink: check computed fonts/readiness, then mask edges, punctuation, and descenders. For confirmed clipping, add scoped mask padding with compensating negative margins; verify spacing and both hidden endpoints before trying compositing workarounds.
- Keep reading accessible with the plugin's ARIA support. If text contains links or controls, keep an unsplit accessible version instead of hiding them.
- Use word-aware wrapping for character animation. Use auto re-split for line animation that must survive width or font changes.
- When line measurement needs fonts, bound the wait or auto-split preparation by the [initialization deadline](initialization.md#bound-initialization-not-choreography). Reserve settled height before splitting if wrappers could shift layout.
- With `autoSplit`, build the animation inside `onSplit` and return it. The plugin records the playhead before a re-split, restores it on the new lines, and waits for fonts itself.
- Svelte updates a `{expression}` text node in place, so a split that replaced it with spans goes stale or breaks when the expression changes. Keep split text out of reactive expressions, or revert in `$effect.pre` and re-split after `tick()` when it must change.
- A split heading takes its timing from the page phase, not its own clock. Give it its own pre-paint rule rather than marking it as a page target, or the page's stagger and the split's rise fight over one element.
- Revert splits on interruption and unmount. Do not leave wrapper spans in stale content.

Revert when the owning phase no longer needs the split. Compare glyph appearance, character positions, wrapping, and height immediately before/after cleanup at desktop/mobile widths, with reduced motion and interruption. Stable boxes alone do not prove stable ink; distinguish subpixel rounding from visible movement.

## Interaction

Pointer motion needs keyboard parity. Pair hover with focus on interactive elements. Do not animate a non-interactive element like a control.

Keep gestures bounded, provide a non-gesture path, and dispose of interaction plugins with their owner. See `gsap-plugins` for Draggable, Observer, and Flip APIs.

## Layout stability and performance

- Prefer `x`, `y`, scale, rotation, and `autoAlpha` over layout properties.
- Use `clip-path`, filters, and variable-font axes deliberately; they can cost paint or shift layout.
- Batch reads before writes.
- The stable wrapper's box should not jump between mount, initial, settled, outro, end, and unmount. Intentional transforms move pixels; layout boxes do not.
- Set `will-change` just before animating and clear it after. Do not promote everything.
- Do not animate hundreds of nodes at once. Reduce targets, batch, or virtualize.
- Do not add a CSS transition or a Svelte directive on a property GSAP controls.
