# Recipe: the wave

Failure contract: apply [effect restoration](../effect-restoration.md) when adapting this module. The framework controller chooses recovery timing; this effect must undo even partial setup.

Splits a heading into letters and, every few seconds, ripples a small move across them left to right, one letter at a time, the way a crowd does the wave. Each pass uses a different move, and every letter ends exactly where it started, so the text never drifts. An optional ambient effect for display text.

The framework skill's controller calls `startWave` at settled (on `idle`) and the returned stop function on outro and unmount; this module never decides when.

Dependencies: `gsap`, `gsap/SplitText`. A variable font supporting the configured weight range for weight moves; no particular font family is required. The example rests at 800 and dips through 400–500. Adapt those weights to the target's actual resting weight and axis, or omit the three weight moves for a static face; keep its existing font.

Setup: follow [stable typography for character animation](../text-stability.md#stable-typography-for-character-animation) before creating splits; keep that target CSS after revert and under reduced motion. Verify the split-to-unsplit boundary with the [cleanup checks](../verification.md#splittext-cleanup-stability).

## Controller contract

`startWave(heading, { period: 1.5 })` returns a stop function. The owner invokes it only after other heading splits are released, and stops it before another effect takes the heading. Use the normal stop path to revert the split; `keepSplit` requires an explicit owner for the retained markup. The controller supplies visibility and resize signals.
